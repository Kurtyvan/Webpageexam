    <p class="t2">Who we are?</p>
        <p style="color:#3b5998" class="t3">Rescue Roots!</p> <p class="t2"> - Rescue Roots is a non-profit organization dedicated to finding loving forever homes for animals in need. We believe that every pet deserves a
            second chance at happiness, and we work tirelessly to connect them with compatible adopters</p>
    <p class="t2">What We Do <br>
            - We rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray animals from various sources <br>
            - We provide our animals with all the necessary medical care, including vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and microchipping. <br>
            - We evaluate each animal's personality and temperament to ensure a successful adoption match. <br>

            - We provide ongoing support and resources to new pet owners. <br>
        </p>   
    <p class="t2">Why Adopt? <br>
     Choosing to adopt is a life-changing decision for both you and the pet. Here are some reasons to consider adoption: <br>
            - Give a deserving animal a loving home. There are countless animals in shelters waiting for a second chance. By adopting, you're saving a life. <br>
            - Find a unique and loving companion. Shelter pets come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. You're sure to find a furry friend who fits perfectly into <br>
               your life. <br>
            - Support a worthy cause. Adoption fees help us continue our mission of rescuing animals and finding them forever homes.

    <p class="t2">Web Designer profile <br>
     Hi, I’m a web designer who creates clean and easy-to-use websites for pet shops. I focus on simple designs that help people find and adopt pets quickly and happily. <br>
            <br>
            I’ve been learning web design for a while. It was a bit hard at first, but I got the hang of it and actually enjoyed building and designing websites. <br>
